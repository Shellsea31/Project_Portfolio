# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

## Description

This week I was tasked to create a website with a portfolio page, an about me page, and a contact page. These sited had to be responsive, meaning they could be visited by users on a variety of devices and screen sizes. Bootstrap was used to add the navbar consistent throughout each page and add javascript to open the menu even on an xs screen. Also Bootstrap gave me the tools to add the form in the contact page.
